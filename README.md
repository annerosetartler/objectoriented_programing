# objectoriented_programing
This project was carried out as a group project during the course “Object-Oriented Programming Techniques” at the Vienna University of Technology in the academic year 2020/21, with Maria Kirschenmann, David Gröbner, and myself. Throughout the semester, practical tasks were implemented based on the topics covered each week.
